# Example Online Store
This example accompanies the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://marklogic-community.github.io/marklogic-data-hub). It demonstrates how to ingest, model, and harmonize multiple data sources for an online board game retailer.

The data are separated into 2 folders under the input/ folder.  
```
|-- input  
  |-- orders
    |-- orders.csv
  |-- products
    |-- board_games.csv
    |-- board_games_accessories.csv
    |-- board_games_apparel.csv
    |-- board_games_extensions.csv
```

# TLDR; How do I run it?
