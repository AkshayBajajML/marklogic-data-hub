# These settings are used by the Data Hub Framework when
# communicating with MarkLogic.
# The values in this file are meant as project-wide settings.
# You can override these properties for a specific environment
# by creating a gradle-{environment}.properties file.
# For example, to create a properties file for your prod environment create a file
# named gradle-prod.properties.

# If specified, the manage username/password combo is used with the ML Management REST API for managing application
# resources; this user must have the manage-admin and rest-admin roles.
#
# If these are not set, then mlUsername/mlPassword is used for managing application resources.
# mlManageUsername=
# mlManagePassword=

# If specified, the admin username/password combo is used with the ML Management REST API for creating users and roles. This
# user must have the manage-admin or admin role. A good practice is to use your admin account here to create app-specific
# users and roles, which can then be used as mlManageUsername/mlManagePassword and mlUsername/mlPassword.
#
# These properties are also used for connecting to the admin application on port 8001 - e.g. for initializing ML and for
# waiting for ML to restart.
#
# If these properties are not set, then mlUsername/mlPassword will be used.
# mlAdminUsername=
# mlAdminPassword=

# If specified, these values can override where the DHF thinks
# MarkLogic default ports are at. You would only use this if you
# have changed the ports on which MarkLogic listens
