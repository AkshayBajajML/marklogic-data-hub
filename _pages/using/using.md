# Understand it first
Before you start using it, we encourage you to [Understand the DHF](../understanding/understanding.md) and to work through the [Tutorial](../tutorial/2x.md).

1. [Ingest Data](../ingest/ingest.md)
1. [Harmonize Data](../harmonize/harmonize.md)  
1. [Serve Data](../serve/serve.md)
