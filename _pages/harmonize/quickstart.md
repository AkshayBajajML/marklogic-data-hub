# Harmonize Using Quickstart

QuickStart is an easy-to-use user interface for working with the Data Hub Framework.

The following parts of the [tutorial](../../tutorial/) describe the harmonize process in QuickStart, from creating an entity to defining and running a harmonize flow:

1. [Create the Product Entity](../../tutorial/create-product-entity/)
1. [Harmonizing the Product Data](../../tutorial/harmonizing-product-data/)
