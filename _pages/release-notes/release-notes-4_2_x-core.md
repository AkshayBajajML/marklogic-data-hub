# Release Notes for DHF 4.2.0

<details open><summary class="relnote-summary">Data Hub Framework 4.2 is now more aligned with Entity Services.</summary>
  <div markdown="1">

  The alignment with Entity Services provides the following benefits:

  - Support for nested entities and 1-to-many relationships among entities.

  - Automatic generation and installation of a TDE template in the SCHEMAS database.

  {% include note.html type="IMPORTANT" content="Entities created in earlier versions are still supported by DHF; however, changes might be required for them to appear without errors in Quickstart. For information on how to restructure your entity, see the <a href='https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/entity-services/models#id_23063'>Entity Services model descriptor syntax documentation</a>." %}
