# Jobs and Traces

MarkLogic tracks:
- the jobs that are performed on your data hub (**Jobs**{:.uilabel})
- the inputs into and outputs from each plugin that runs during a flow (**Traces**{:.uilabel})

These **Jobs**{:.uilabel} and **Traces**{:.uilabel} logs can help troubleshoot errors in your flows.
