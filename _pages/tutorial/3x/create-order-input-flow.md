# Getting Started Tutorial<br>Create the Order Input Flow

Next, we will create an input flow for orders so that we can load data as-is. We follow the same procedure we used to create the products input flow.

To begin, click **Flows** in the top navigation bar, then follow these steps:

1. Click on **Order** to show the Input and Harmonize Flows.
1. Click the **+** icon next to **Input Flows**. The Create Input Flow dialog appears.
1. Type **Load Orders** in the **Input Flow Name** field.
1. Click **Create** to create the new flow.

The following picture summarizes this procedure:
