# Tutorial: Create the Order Entity

Next, we will create an Order entity, following the same procedure we used to create the Product entity.

Click **Entities** on the top navigation bar.

![Click Entities]({{site.baseurl}}/images/3x/create-order-entity/entities-select.png)

Follow these steps:

1. Click <span class="circle-button"><i class="fa fa-wrench"></i></span> to open the entity tools control.
1. Click **New Entity**. The entity creation dialog appears.
1. Type **Order** in the Title field.
1. Click **SAVE**. The new Order entity is displayed. If you are prompted to update the index, click No.

You have just created your second entity, the Order entity.

{% include note.html type="NOTE" content="The Order entity might be hidden behind the Product entity. Click and drag the Product entity to uncover the Order entity." %}

The following picture summarizes the steps for creating the Order entity.
