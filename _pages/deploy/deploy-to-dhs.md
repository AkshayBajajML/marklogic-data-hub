# Deploy to MarkLogic Data Hub Service

## Data Hub Service

You can deploy your DHF project in the cloud instead of setting up your own. The [MarkLogic Data Hub Service (DHS)](https://www.marklogic.com/blog/introducing-marklogic-data-hub-service/) is a cloud-based solution that provides a preconfigured MarkLogic cluster in which you can run flows and from which you can serve harmonized data.

For the most up-to-date instructions on deploying to DHS, see [Data Hub 5.0 - Deploy to Data Hub Service](https://docs.marklogic.com/datahub/projects/deploy-to-cloud-services.html).
