# Create a DHF Project

The first step in using the Data Hub Framework is to create a DHF project, if you do not already have one. You can do this via the QuickStart UI or the Gradle plugin.

- [QuickStart](quickstart.md) - A user interface for developing with DHF. Use QuickStart if you want to get started with DHF quickly. QuickStart is not supported for production use.
- [Gradle Plugin](gradle.md) - The Gradle plugin allows you to interact with DHF from the command line. The Gradle plugin is supported for production use.


After creating your project, you can also set up [flow tracing]({{site.baseurl}}/project/flow-tracing/) to retain a detailed record of what happens during your ingest and harmonize flows.
