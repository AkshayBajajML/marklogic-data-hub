# Creating a Data Hub Project

Before you can get started you need to create a Data Hub Project. You can do this via the QuickStart UI or the Gradle plugin.

1. [QuickStart UI](quickstart.md) - A user interface for developing against the DHF.  
Use the Quickstart tool if want to get started with DHF quickly.
1. [Gradle Plugin: ml-data-hub](gradle.md) - This Gradle plugin allows you to interact with the DHF from a command line.
Use the Gradle plugin if you prefer the command line.
