If you are upgrading both DHF and MarkLogic, you can upgrade them independently of each other as long as you are running at least the [minimally supported version of MarkLogic Server]({{site.baseurl}}/understanding/upgrading/#requirements) for your current DHF version. If you are running an older version of MarkLogic Server, then you must upgrade MarkLogic Server before upgrading DHF.
